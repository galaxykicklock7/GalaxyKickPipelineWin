MODES EXPLANATION:
- kickmode: true  = KICK mode (removes user from planet)
- kickmode: false = IMPRISON mode (sends user to prison)

AI MODE EXPLANATION:
- aiMode: false = Manual timing (use attack1-5, waiting1-5 values)
- aiMode: true  = AUTO mode with optimal defaults:
  * Auto-detects opponent timing from competition results
  * YOU WIN → Opponent was slower (inferred timing)
  * YOU GET IMPRISONED → Opponent was faster (they won!)
  * Finds optimal timing (20-30 seconds)
  * HARD CAP: Maximum 2100ms (will NEVER exceed this limit)
  * Fast feedback (±15ms adjustments)
  * Rolling window (15 seconds)
  * Updates every 5 rounds
  * Adaptive mode (continuously optimizes)
  NO OTHER CONFIGURATION NEEDED - All defaults are optimal!

IMPORTANT: AI Mode maximum is HARD CAPPED at 2100ms
  Detects opponent timing from actual game results:
  - When you successfully imprison → Opponent was slower
  - When you get imprisoned → Opponent was faster
  Example: Opponents at 1800-2000ms → Range: 1700-2100ms (capped!)
  Example: Opponents at 1900-2150ms → Range: 1800-2100ms (capped!)
